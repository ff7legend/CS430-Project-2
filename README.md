CS430-Project-1

Project 1 for CS430 Graphics

How to run the file

Just as described in the instructions you compile on Linux with gcc project1.c which will output a.exe

To convert you run the excecutable, the number you wish to convert to, the original file you are converting from and then the output file (this can be a file not yet created).

EX: ppmrw.exe [3|6] [camP3.ppm | camP6.ppm] output.ppm.

The Makefile

To run the make file on Linux I simply ran a make command and it outputted the pppmrw executable.
# CS430-Project-2
